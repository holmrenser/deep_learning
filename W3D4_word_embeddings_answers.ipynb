    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "'rome' becomes 'berlin', exactly as expected. Belgium does not work, returning 'paris' instead of 'brussels'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2\n",
    "The 10 closest words to 'water' include 'dry' and 'sand', indicating co-occurrence (which was used for training) does not always capture semantic similarity. A wider context might be necessary to capture the true semantic meaning of an individual word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3\n",
    "You could use a dimensionality reduction technique like PCA (linear) or tSNE (nin-linear) to plot embedding points in 2D. Given that PCA is linear, you would expect that the arithmetic performed in example 4 would result in predictable positions in the plot."
